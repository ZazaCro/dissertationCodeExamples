# Computational investigation of immersion quenching: understanding to boiling conjugate heat transfer

This repository consists of OpenFOAM code, simulation examples and video of cylinder quenching acquired during an experiment. These data are discussed in my PhD thesis.

The code is tested with OpenFOAM-v1906 and is not initially meant for public use. Thus, the way the code is written is not necessarily the most efficient or user-friendly. Please follow the PhD thesis if you desire to look at the code. Also, the code is not stand alone. Precompiled OpenFOAM toolbox is needed.
