# Computational investigation of immersion quenching:  understanding to boiling conjugate heat transfer

This project consists of OpenFOAM code and simulation examples to accompany my PhD thesis.


The code is tested with OpenFOAM-v1906 and is not initially meant for public use. Thus, the way the code is written is not necessarily the most efficient or user friendly. Please follow the PhD thesis if you desire to look at the code. Also, the code is not stand alone. Precompiled OpenFOAM toolbox is needed.

## Directories


* chtMultiRegionTwoPhaseEulerFoam - Source code of a solver (application) used for the research
* src - Source code of some post-Processing tools/features used during the research
* BFS - Simulation example of a backward-facing step with conjugate heat transfer
* plate - Simulation example of thin horizontal plate quenched in water
* cylinder - Simulation example of cylinder quenched in water
